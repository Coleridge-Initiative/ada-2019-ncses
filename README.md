# ada-ncses-2019

The **National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES)** in Alexandria, Virginia hosted the Fall 2019 **Coleridge Initiative Applied Data Analytics training program** on-site at the **National Science Foundation (NSF)**. 

Participants work in teams to define and complete a project aimed at gaining insights into employment outcomes for doctoral recipients, exploring factors that may affect whether graduates go into industry or academia and other outcomes such as salary. The program provides up-to-date perspective on the use of administrative and survey data for policy analysis, and instruction on how to manage and analyze micro data according to best practices. Instructors facilitate hands-on coding of micro data in SQL and Python for the following tasks: data management, record linkage, data visualization, and machine learning. The additional four days beyond the base 6 day program provides additional project time and further analysis modules such as network analysis, text analysis and the use of APIs. 

**Datasets Used in the Class**:

- Survey of Earned Doctorates, Survey of Doctorate Recipients, Higher Education Research and Development Survey (provided by NCSES)
